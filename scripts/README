The empirical dataset can be recreated by running the subsampler.py script on the Trinity Mouse data available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinityrnaseq/files/misc/MouseRNASEQ/mouse_SS_rnaseq.50M.fastqs.tgz/download
The simulated dataset is available at http://datadryad.org


All assemblies can be downoaded at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.725715

The scripts contained in this folder can be used to recreate analysis

sim.par: This is the parameter file needed by the Flux Simulator. Running this should produce 30 million 100nt paired-end simulated Illumina reads
subsampler.py: see above. Useful for subsampling an Illumina dataset
allp.ec.sh: This is the code for running the AllPathsLG error correction module
rept.config.script: This is the config file that reprile requires. Settings indicated by the test are to be optimized for each specific dataset, using instructions provided by the readme contined in the Reptile download
trin.sh: this is the code for running a basic Trinity asssembly

rept.pipeline.sh: This file contains a list of the commands that will allow for the production of Reptile error correcte reads.It includesa adaptor and quality trimming steps using Trimmomatic.
